{"name":"Meteor-boiler","tagline":"my meteor boilerplate with AdminLTE bootstrap theme, customized for meteor","body":"Simple Meteor Boilerplate \r\n\r\nThis meteor boilerplate is coming out of my frustrations in coming with a good theme that is responsive and works as soon as you clone it. The main motivations are to have something sophesticated that is working straight out of the box, that can be customizable and has a robust set of patterns that can be mimiced for a larger undertaking. \r\n\r\nThe primary goals in priority order:\r\n   - A good customizable theme\r\n   - Security\r\n   - Judicious use of key packages\r\n   - Working iOS & Android containers\r\n   - Testing with Velocity & Cucumberjs + patterns that can be followed\r\n   - Finally, everything should work out of the box \r\n\r\nTo that end I have created a public roadmap for this on Trello. Shoot me an email or open an issue if it needs to be added to the roadmap.\r\n\r\nRoadmap: [meteor boiler @ trello][trello]\r\nDemo: [meteor-boiler][demo]\r\n\r\nThis boilerplate uses the following themes and packages. \r\n\r\nTheme AdminLTE:\r\n   - Provides a decent responsive bootstrap-3 theme \r\n   - Boilerplate is tested for 3 breakpoints\r\n\r\nLogging:\r\n   - Pince\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n   - Velocity & Cucumberjs\r\n   - The tests folder contains a set of examples, tags and hooks which allows   for working through this from the ground up\r\n   - Browser-based end-to-end testing with velocity, cucumber & webdriver.io\r\n\r\nIntegrated & Tested Packages:\r\n   - UserAccounts\r\n   - Collection2 \r\n   - AutoForm\r\n   - FlashMessages\r\n   - roles - todo\r\n   - user-admin - todo\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\n   - audit-argument-checks\r\n   - Browser Policy d\r\n   - checks in Meteor methods\r\n   - sanitize-html (todo)\r\n   - ongoworks:security (todo)\r\n\r\nCRUD\r\n   - A pattern to do CRUD for collections as securely as possible\r\n   - This pattern can be copied and adapted for more collections\r\n\r\n[trello]: https://trello.com/b/grrlZ9pd/meteor-boilerplate\r\n[demo]: http://meteor-boiler.meteor.com\r\n\r\n\t\r\n","google":"UA-60402015-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
