Simple Meteor Boilerplate 

This meteor boilerplate is coming out of my frustrations in coming with a good theme that is responsive and works as soon as you clone it. 

This boilerplate uses the following themes and packages. 

Theme: AdminLTE
	- Provides a decent responsive bootstrap-3 theme 
	- Boilerplate is tested for 3 breakpoints

Logging:
	mrt:trail for logging

Testing:
	Velocity & Cucumberjs
	The tests folder contains a set of examples, tags and hooks which allows for working through this from the ground up
	Browser-based end-to-end testing with velocity, cucumber & webdriver.io

UserAccounts

Collection2 & AutoForm

Security:
	audit-argument-checks
	checks in Meteor methods
	Browser Policy (TODO)
